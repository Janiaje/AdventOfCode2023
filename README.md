# [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023/leaderboard/private/view/132354)

This project contains my solutions for the Advent of Code 2024 challenge.

# Running the code

Each day is solved using different programming languages.

To make it easier to execute the code, I included Dockerfiles for each folder/language.

- You can run the following commands in a terminal:
    ```bash
    docker build -t solution . && docker run --rm -it solution
    ```
- Or you can simply click the green play button in the Dockerfile ;)
